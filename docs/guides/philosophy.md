# Lithair Philosophy: The Origin Story

**By Yoan Roblet**

_"I just wanted to build a simple website, and I was already exhausted by the architecture part, especially the database."_

## 🎯 The Frustration That Started It All

My name is **Yoan Roblet**, and Lithair was born from a simple, universal frustration that every web developer knows too well.

Picture this: You have a brilliant idea for a web application. Maybe it's an e-commerce site, a blog, a social platform—doesn't matter. You're excited, motivated, ready to build something amazing.

Then reality hits.

Before you can write a single line of business logic, you're drowning in architectural decisions:

- **Frontend**: React or Vue? Webpack or Vite? TypeScript or JavaScript?
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Go, or Rust? Express, FastAPI, or Gin?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB? How do I handle migrations?
- **Infrastructure**: Docker? Kubernetes? AWS or Google Cloud?
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines, load balancers, monitoring...

**For what? Three simple tables!**

I found myself spending 80% of my time on infrastructure and only 20% on the actual product. The thing I was passionate about—the business logic, the user experience, the problem I wanted to solve—became an afterthought.

## 💡 The Epiphany

One day, after setting up yet another PostgreSQL connection pool for a simple CRUD application, I had an epiphany:

**"What if we didn't need all this complexity?"**

## 🤝 A Note on Respect

**Let me be crystal clear**: I'm not criticizing existing tools. I use PostgreSQL, React, Kubernetes, and all these amazing technologies every day. They are incredible achievements that have enabled the modern web.

This isn't about what's wrong with current tools—it's about **what's possible with a different approach**.

## 🔮 A Modern Vision of Computing

My insight came from observing how computing has evolved:

### The Old Paradigm (1990s-2010s)

- **Scarcity mindset**: CPU, memory, and network were expensive
- **Separation of concerns**: Database server, application server, web server
- **SQL as the universal interface**: Connect, query, disconnect
- **Network as a necessary evil**: Accept the latency, manage the connections

### The New Reality (2020s+)

- **Abundance mindset**: CPU and memory are cheap, networks are fast
- **Co-location possibilities**: Everything can run on the same node
- **Delta synchronization**: Share changes, not full state
- **Network as an optimization**: Use it for coordination, not every operation

### Learning from Distributed Storage

Systems like **Ceph** have already proven this concept in storage:

- Instead of connecting to a central storage server, each node IS storage
- Instead of network I/O for every read, data is local
- Instead of bottlenecks, you get linear scaling
- **Result**: Much higher IOPS and throughput

Lithair applies the same principle to databases:

- Instead of connecting to a database server, each node IS the database
- Instead of network queries, everything is in-memory
- Instead of connection pools, you get direct access
- **Result**: 1,000,000x faster reads

## 🚀 The Core Philosophy: "We ARE the Database"

This became Lithair's foundation: What if, instead of connecting TO a database, we simply ARE the database?

What if web development could be as simple as writing a single Rust file and running `cargo build`?

**This isn't criticism—it's evolution.**

### From Idea to Production

**Traditional Path:**

```
Brilliant Idea → Architecture Hell → 6 Months Later → Still Configuring → Idea Dies
```

**Lithair Path:**

```
Brilliant Idea → Write Business Logic → cargo build → Ship to Production → Success!
```

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**

_"The best architecture is the one you don't have to think about."_

Lithair eliminates architectural decisions by making the right choices for you. Whether you're serving 10 users on your laptop or 1 million users on a Kubernetes cluster, the same binary scales naturally without architectural changes.

### 2. **Developer Happiness**

_"If you're not having fun building it, your users won't have fun using it."_

Web development should be joyful, not a chore. Lithair brings back the joy by letting you focus on what matters: your product.

### 3. **Performance by Design**

_"Why accept milliseconds when you can have nanoseconds?"_

By embedding the database in the application process, we eliminate the fundamental bottleneck of all web applications: network latency to the database.

### 4. **Natural Scalability**

_"Complexity should be optional, not mandatory."_

Start simple with a single binary. When you need to scale, the same code that handles 10 users on your laptop seamlessly handles millions on Kubernetes. No rewrites, no architectural changes—just horizontal scaling.

### 5. **Declarative Over Custom: The 90% Rule**

_"Most websites need the same things. Why keep rebuilding them?"_

Lithair embraces a powerful insight: **90% of websites share the same core requirements**:

- User authentication and sessions
- CRUD operations on data models
- Role-based permissions
- Static asset serving
- Form validation
- API endpoints

Instead of forcing you to implement these patterns from scratch every time, Lithair provides **declarative defaults** that handle the common cases automatically:

```rust
LithairServer::new()
    .with_rbac_config(rbac_config)           // Auth + sessions + roles
    .with_model_full::<Article>("/articles") // Full CRUD + RBAC
    .with_frontend("public")                 // Static serving
    .serve()                                 // That's it!
```

**The Philosophy:**

- ✅ **Declarative first**: Common patterns are built-in and configured, not coded
- ✅ **Zero boilerplate**: No need to write authentication handlers for the 100th time
- ✅ **Convention over configuration**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- ✅ **Customizable when needed**: Every declarative feature can be overridden with custom logic

**But here's the key**: When you DO need custom behavior (the remaining 10%), it's **simple and explicit**:

```rust
// Custom route when you need it
.with_route(Method::GET, "/special", |req| {
    Box::pin(async move {
        // Your custom logic here
        Ok(Response::new("Custom behavior"))
    })
})
```

**The balance:**

- 🎯 For 90% of use cases: Use declarative patterns, ship faster
- 🔧 For 10% of special needs: Drop into custom code, stay in control

This isn't about removing flexibility—it's about removing the **need** for it in common scenarios. Why write 50 lines of authentication code when `.with_rbac_config()` does it better?

**The goal:** Spend your time on what makes YOUR app unique, not reimplementing authentication for the 100th time.

## 🌟 The Personal Journey

### Before Lithair

I was that developer who:

- Spent weeks setting up development environments
- Got lost in Docker configurations
- Fought with database migrations
- Deployed to 5 different services for a simple app
- Paid $20/month for infrastructure that served 10 users

### After Lithair

Now I:

- Write business logic from day one
- Deploy with `cargo build && ./my-app`
- Scale naturally when needed
- Pay $5/month for infrastructure that can serve millions
- Actually ship products instead of configuring them

## 🎯 The Mission

**Lithair exists to give developers their time back.**

Time to focus on:

- ✅ **Your users** instead of your infrastructure
- ✅ **Your product** instead of your deployment pipeline
- ✅ **Your ideas** instead of your database schema
- ✅ **Your creativity** instead of your configuration files

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

## 💭 Why I Built This

People sometimes ask: "Why not just use existing solutions?"

Honestly, existing solutions work great. PostgreSQL, React, Express—they're all solid tools that I use regularly.

But I kept finding myself in the same situation: wanting to build something simple, then spending days setting up the infrastructure before writing any actual business logic.

So I thought, "What if I just tried a different approach?" What if the database was just... part of the app? No separate server, no connection strings, no migrations.

Lithair is basically that experiment. It might be a terrible idea, but I wanted to see what would happen.

Plus, honestly, it's also a learning project for me. I wanted to explore beyond basic SQL and see what technologies like Raft consensus and event sourcing could bring to modern web development. It's been pretty interesting to dive into these concepts.

I should mention that this experimentation wouldn't have been possible without AI assistance (specifically Claude). The amount of techniques involved—Raft consensus, event sourcing, HTTP parsing, Rust async programming—would have taken me years to learn and implement on my own. Having an AI pair programming partner made it possible to actually explore these ideas instead of just reading about them.

## 🤷 That's It

This might not make sense for most projects. If your current setup works well, stick with it.

But if you've ever started a new project and felt overwhelmed by all the setup before you could write your first line of business logic, maybe this approach could be interesting.

It's just one way of doing things. Not better or worse, just different.
